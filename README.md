# Hi there 👋

I'm actually work as full-stack web developer, starting in Fall 2019. I'm always curious about web tech and I keep everytime studying new code languages. I worked for a Bank for 8 years, now I become a trader in 2017 two years after studying the financial markets, such as Forex, Futures, Options and Shares. Actually based in Cremona 🎻, Italy
